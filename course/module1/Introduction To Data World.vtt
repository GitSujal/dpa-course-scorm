Welcome to the Data Profession Academy.

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:05.250
This video is a part of our data analyst
playlist, where we cover everything you

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.980
need to know to become a data analyst.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.580
We will post content every week.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.350
So stay tuned.

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:11.090
Today is day one of our content.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.559
Today, we will talk about the
exciting world of data in our

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.080
introduction to data world section.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.220
We will learn how to
think like a data analyst.

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.130
I will also show you some examples
of how data is used in the real

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.600
world to drive business decisions.

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:23.110
Let's jump into today's session.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:24.850
Today we will learn about.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.440
What data is, what data career looks
like, what sort of different data

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.380
careers are available there, and
what does a data professional do, or

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.330
how does a data professional think?

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.400
And that's probably the most important
part is learning if you are given any

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.190
problem, how do you start thinking from
the data professionals perspective?

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.590
And that's the key thing we will
learn today is try to understand how

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.910
a data professional think Okay,  so
let's jump into the content now.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.750
First thing, obviously we
need to know is what data is.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.980
The definition of data
is evolving every day.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.210
So previously we only used to think that
data is some numbers or some spreadsheet

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.580
where you have rows and columns and you
have data in those rows and columns.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.375
That's, used to be like a
common thinking about data.

00:01:21.075 --> 00:01:26.315
But with all this evolution, with all
these advances in technologies, now

00:01:26.385 --> 00:01:32.475
everything has become data, for example,
you guys are attending the meeting today.

00:01:32.775 --> 00:01:33.785
That's also a data.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.540
You guys, some guys are not attending
the meeting, that's also data.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.550
And you are looking at this screen,
so your screen time is also data.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.220
You are moving your mouse here
and there, so that pattern of

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.210
your mouse movement is also data.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.030
You probably are wearing some watch,
so your heartbeat is being tracked,

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.870
so your heartbeat is also a data.

00:01:54.365 --> 00:01:58.685
Everything you can possibly think
of  is now being treated as data.

00:01:58.795 --> 00:02:01.775
you post something on your social
media that's another data point.

00:02:01.985 --> 00:02:04.865
Someone likes on that social
media, that's another data point.

00:02:04.865 --> 00:02:09.295
Someone sees your post and does not like
it, that's again another data point.

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:11.635
So data is just almost everywhere.

00:02:12.635 --> 00:02:16.605
And that's what makes it really
interesting is trying to find that

00:02:16.605 --> 00:02:21.835
data that maybe no one else ever
thought about using or no one else

00:02:21.885 --> 00:02:26.995
actually thought that it existed and
turning that into meaningful insight.

00:02:27.305 --> 00:02:30.846
That's what data professionals
do,  so if you were just normal

00:02:30.886 --> 00:02:34.236
data that everyone saw, that normal
spreadsheets and whatever, Then

00:02:34.236 --> 00:02:37.666
turning those into meaningful
insights that's like a normal thing.

00:02:37.756 --> 00:02:42.626
And even the AIs these days
are good enough to  turn

00:02:42.626 --> 00:02:44.336
those things into insights.

00:02:44.866 --> 00:02:48.466
But what a data professional, what
a true data professional can do

00:02:48.496 --> 00:02:53.871
is, identify those data points
that no one ever considered before.

00:02:54.181 --> 00:02:57.091
that's where the majority
of the value comes from.

00:02:57.141 --> 00:03:02.901
It's not, it is from those existing
data as well, but it's the ability

00:03:02.901 --> 00:03:08.761
to find those data from those
unusual places and make it useful.

00:03:08.901 --> 00:03:12.511
That's one of the biggest strength
or that's one of the biggest

00:03:12.521 --> 00:03:18.041
quality of a data professional
is the ability to uncover or find

00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:19.461
those interesting data points.

00:03:20.461 --> 00:03:24.741
That's why the world through a data
lens is that for data professional,

00:03:25.011 --> 00:03:26.901
the world is full of data points.

00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:31.731
And that's why you will explore every
nooks and corners of it to find those

00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:36.321
exciting and interesting data points
and turn them into meaningful insight.

00:03:36.321 --> 00:03:39.691
Data professional is not
like they will just wait for

00:03:39.691 --> 00:03:41.241
someone to hand them the data.

00:03:41.661 --> 00:03:43.521
That doesn't make you a data professional.

00:03:43.941 --> 00:03:47.361
A data professional should be
able to identify where that

00:03:47.361 --> 00:03:50.971
data is how to get it and how to
turn it into meaningful insight.

00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:56.201
And that's what we're here to learn
is how to identify those interesting

00:03:56.201 --> 00:04:01.631
data points that probably are
sitting just in front of our eyes,

00:04:01.671 --> 00:04:03.961
but we are failing to identify them.

00:04:03.961 --> 00:04:08.291
And the, yeah, the role often involves
merging different data points.

00:04:08.301 --> 00:04:11.481
So yeah, you will probably use some
of the data that you already knew

00:04:11.481 --> 00:04:13.851
and existed, but you will create.

00:04:14.606 --> 00:04:19.986
some data points from, some different
sources that no one else thought of or you

00:04:19.986 --> 00:04:26.576
try to combine two different data sources
that no one Else ever thought of combining

00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:28.956
and there was a quite interesting example.

00:04:28.956 --> 00:04:32.166
I found on linkedin one
day and it was from India.

00:04:32.626 --> 00:04:39.026
So someone was planning to apply
for a job in a company, but finding

00:04:39.026 --> 00:04:43.116
the salary label of people in
that company is a bit hard, right?

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:45.976
Because people don't advertise
about the company doesn't

00:04:45.976 --> 00:04:47.606
advertise about the salary label.

00:04:47.796 --> 00:04:52.496
People also don't LinkedIn
or like any other portal.

00:04:53.146 --> 00:04:57.826
But what she found that was
people actually list their.

00:04:58.306 --> 00:05:01.966
occupation and their salary
in matrimonial sites.

00:05:02.726 --> 00:05:07.226
So what she did was she looked for that
company in the matrimonial sites and

00:05:07.236 --> 00:05:09.406
she found the salary data from there.

00:05:10.606 --> 00:05:13.996
And that was quite interesting because
yeah, people probably don't go to

00:05:14.006 --> 00:05:18.856
matrimonial sites to try to find
the salary for a company, right?

00:05:18.996 --> 00:05:20.956
Or what are the salary
levels for a company?

00:05:21.686 --> 00:05:24.776
But she tried and she
actually got it, right?

00:05:24.816 --> 00:05:26.096
And that's the interesting thing.

00:05:26.096 --> 00:05:27.736
And that's what being a
true data professional.

00:05:28.326 --> 00:05:33.646
Is about is trying to find those unique
places or different places where the

00:05:33.646 --> 00:05:37.776
data might be there or interesting
data is there and try to combine

00:05:37.776 --> 00:05:40.426
that and get a meaningful insight.

00:05:40.426 --> 00:05:43.586
That's what looking at the world
through the data lens means you are

00:05:43.776 --> 00:05:49.196
always trying to find those interesting
data points that you can convert into

00:05:49.196 --> 00:05:51.266
meaningful knowledge and insights.

00:05:51.266 --> 00:05:54.266
And  that's where the curiosity of
data professional comes in as well.

00:05:54.936 --> 00:06:00.485
So if the idea of discovering these kind
of new data sources and uncovering those

00:06:00.496 --> 00:06:05.736
hidden insights excites you, then, that's
exactly what a data professional needs.

00:06:05.736 --> 00:06:10.326
And if you have that curiosity, you will
make a really good data professional.

00:06:10.606 --> 00:06:12.546
Okay, it's not about your technical skill.

00:06:12.566 --> 00:06:13.866
Yeah, technical skills are there.

00:06:13.866 --> 00:06:15.606
You need to learn those tools and stuff.

00:06:15.606 --> 00:06:15.646
Yeah.

00:06:16.081 --> 00:06:17.231
But it's the mindset.

00:06:17.271 --> 00:06:20.611
If you have got the right mindset,
you can learn those tools.

00:06:20.611 --> 00:06:24.971
And yeah, because those tools when
you are applying for jobs and when

00:06:24.971 --> 00:06:28.651
you, when we look at average data
analyst versus a good data analyst.

00:06:29.246 --> 00:06:33.456
They probably know the same tools,
but the good data analyst is a good

00:06:33.456 --> 00:06:36.746
data analyst because they have got
this kind of curiosity and they

00:06:36.746 --> 00:06:41.386
have got this kind of perspective of
looking everything through data lens.

00:06:41.386 --> 00:06:42.296
Does that make sense?

00:06:42.346 --> 00:06:45.486
Let's talk about data versus
information versus knowledge

00:06:45.686 --> 00:06:47.326
and the evolution of value.

00:06:47.706 --> 00:06:51.866
Okay, so this is really important to know
the difference between what data is, what

00:06:51.886 --> 00:06:54.016
information is, and what knowledge is.

00:06:55.096 --> 00:06:57.436
Okay, so what is data?

00:06:57.936 --> 00:07:03.186
Data is at the most basic level is the
raw collection of facts and figures.

00:07:03.836 --> 00:07:03.866
Okay.

00:07:03.876 --> 00:07:07.356
So everything that we talked about
previously, like those social

00:07:07.386 --> 00:07:12.186
media posts, likes, heartbeat, your
purchase history whatever you can

00:07:12.196 --> 00:07:14.906
think of, those are all data, right?

00:07:14.906 --> 00:07:16.046
So they are just raw.

00:07:16.046 --> 00:07:21.826
They are just the collection of
facts and in itself, the data has no

00:07:21.836 --> 00:07:27.936
value, ? So your purchase history in
itself, it doesn't benefit anyone,

00:07:28.296 --> 00:07:31.456
but when someone analyzes that
purchase history, maybe that's you.

00:07:31.821 --> 00:07:36.731
So you yourself are analyzing your
purchase history and you found out that

00:07:36.731 --> 00:07:39.061
there were some costs that you can cut.

00:07:39.061 --> 00:07:42.681
Now that becomes information
and that will be of value.

00:07:42.681 --> 00:07:48.501
The purchase history in itself, it didn't
have any value, but when you analyzed

00:07:48.501 --> 00:07:53.631
it and converted it into information
and then use that information to drive

00:07:53.631 --> 00:07:57.241
some decisions, which probably will be
like, yeah, I probably don't need to buy

00:07:57.241 --> 00:08:00.861
this too much, or I can buy this from
some other place where it's cheaper.

00:08:01.276 --> 00:08:06.246
And then you are now generating value
from the data, so there is data, which

00:08:06.276 --> 00:08:11.476
is just the raw collection of facts,
which doesn't have any value on itself.

00:08:12.446 --> 00:08:16.206
But when you analyze it and  use
it to drive a decision, That's

00:08:16.206 --> 00:08:17.606
when it will generate the value.

00:08:18.306 --> 00:08:21.786
And this is what, this is the journey
that data analyst has to travel.

00:08:22.456 --> 00:08:28.616
So a data analyst has to be able to take
a data, convert it into information, and

00:08:28.616 --> 00:08:30.906
that information should drive a decision.

00:08:30.916 --> 00:08:34.476
Urging people or urging other
people to make that decision is

00:08:34.486 --> 00:08:38.526
also data analyst's job,  so your
job is not just to produce insight.

00:08:38.576 --> 00:08:42.426
Yeah, you'll probably produce insight,
you'll probably produce charts and

00:08:42.426 --> 00:08:44.836
KPIs and numbers, whatever it is.

00:08:45.386 --> 00:08:48.986
But if you cannot convince the
other person who needs to make

00:08:48.986 --> 00:08:52.356
that then it's of no use, fine.

00:08:52.846 --> 00:08:56.406
For example, in the same case, like
when you were doing your own analysis

00:08:56.436 --> 00:09:00.696
of your purchase history, if you can't
convince yourself that, okay, you need

00:09:00.726 --> 00:09:05.906
to do cost coding on this item, Did
the analysis, is the analysis useful?

00:09:06.196 --> 00:09:07.616
Did it generate any value?

00:09:08.206 --> 00:09:12.066
No, because the decision was
not taken not even decision.

00:09:12.076 --> 00:09:15.696
The action was not taken because
unless you take an action nothing

00:09:15.716 --> 00:09:19.305
really happens because the analysis
in itself doesn't generate value

00:09:19.586 --> 00:09:21.336
is the action that generates value.

00:09:21.336 --> 00:09:24.516
That's why the first part
is from data to information.

00:09:24.516 --> 00:09:27.116
That's analysis from
information to action.

00:09:27.135 --> 00:09:28.726
That's the communication skills.

00:09:29.621 --> 00:09:34.221
And there's the data storytelling and
communication that we definitely focus on

00:09:34.271 --> 00:09:39.511
in the later part of our course yes, now
you have got that analysis, but how you

00:09:39.531 --> 00:09:41.660
can convert this analysis into action.

00:09:42.271 --> 00:09:45.001
Who do you need to convince
and how would you convince it

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:50.360
convincing there also needs those
evidence and facts to support it.

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:53.900
You can't go to someone and say, hey,
you need to do a cost cutting on this

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.640
one, or you need to stop buying this.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.040
You need to have  evidence backing for
that claim that you are making,  and

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.350
that's where the analysis comes in.

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:02.650
I hope that's making sense.

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:06.840
So that's where the data versus
information versus knowledge comes in.

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:11.221
So if you to plot a value
axis, let me see if I can draw

00:10:11.411 --> 00:10:16.871
it  if This was the value axis.

00:10:16.881 --> 00:10:18.641
So let's call it this is value.

00:10:19.341 --> 00:10:23.401
And if we go down this
way, the value increases.

00:10:24.161 --> 00:10:27.230
So if that's the case,
then data will be on here.

00:10:27.511 --> 00:10:31.931
So this is where the data will be because
data in itself doesn't have any value.

00:10:32.301 --> 00:10:34.211
Because the raw data
doesn't give you anything.

00:10:35.516 --> 00:10:39.246
But information will be somewhere
around here because now you

00:10:39.246 --> 00:10:42.556
have analyzed the data and you
have produced some information.

00:10:42.556 --> 00:10:45.506
You have produced some trends,
some patterns and things like that.

00:10:45.506 --> 00:10:50.456
But knowledge is somewhere
around here because knowledge is

00:10:50.466 --> 00:10:52.536
something that people can act on.

00:10:53.075 --> 00:10:59.596
Okay, so based on this information, now
I can maybe deduce some accents saying,

00:10:59.596 --> 00:11:01.426
okay, this is the pattern I'm following.

00:11:01.426 --> 00:11:03.986
This is something that I'm
spending too much money on.

00:11:04.381 --> 00:11:06.251
Let's try to reduce that scots.

00:11:06.431 --> 00:11:10.911
That's what knowledge is and that's
the thing that gives you value It's not

00:11:10.961 --> 00:11:16.050
information alone  But the knowledge
is what gives you value and I think we

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.970
have got an example here as well okay.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:19.570
Yeah, there you go.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:25.270
So for instance consider a retail
company which are tracking every

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:29.160
customer transaction just Think
of like calls or willies, right?

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.610
So every time you scan an item
that is being tracked, right?

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:35.150
So they know what you're buying, what
you're not buying, all those things.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:40.400
So these records by themselves
don't tell the company much, right?

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.820
So you're buying 10 items or you
buy this and that item, that data in

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:47.550
itself doesn't help that company much.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.640
But let's get into the information now.

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:57.900
So in the same example, let's say that
the company found that the average basket

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.220
size for each customer is decreasing.

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:03.970
So previously people were buying
10 items together, now they are

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:05.620
just buying 8 items together.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.260
So they found that trend.

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:11.040
And that now is somewhat useful, right?

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:15.690
But in order to make it fully useful
and generate the value out of it, now

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.700
they have to add something on top of it.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.240
And that's the domain experience.

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:27.460
So what they did is, in this scenario, the
sales manager will be the domain expert.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:33.740
they interpret the information
and they identify that The store's

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:39.070
BYO bag policy happened around the
same time that the train went down.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:44.770
So for instance, maybe they launched
their BYO bag policy in September,

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:50.200
and the average basket size started
to decrease since September.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:53.370
So now they know the root
cause that, okay, yes, because

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:55.780
we're not giving people bags.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:58.630
They can't really hold
much items on their hand.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:03.940
So obviously the basket size will
go down So what they did on and

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.970
now is the accent time, right?

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:08.540
Because if they just know that
thing and don't take an accent

00:13:09.075 --> 00:13:10.595
Again, it doesn't give any value.

00:13:11.155 --> 00:13:14.725
So what's the action could
be is I'll do this knowledge.

00:13:15.025 --> 00:13:19.835
The store introduces a reusable
bag for 1 or whatever it is.

00:13:20.575 --> 00:13:26.145
And that will probably help them
again, increase that basket size.

00:13:26.955 --> 00:13:31.915
So this is a typical example on
how data becomes information.

00:13:32.215 --> 00:13:35.914
And then information is now
combined with those domain

00:13:35.914 --> 00:13:38.585
expertise to convert into knowledge.

00:13:39.055 --> 00:13:42.515
And that knowledge is what
we take actions upon, right?

00:13:42.675 --> 00:13:46.925
So the action was taken the store
introduces the Reusable bags for

00:13:46.925 --> 00:13:53.130
one dollar and then that gives them
the outcome the value So this is the

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:57.140
timeline or the progression of data.

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:00.871
And that's what as a data
professional, you need to be aware of.

00:14:01.101 --> 00:14:06.001
It's your job to take, to get it
from data all the way to knowledge.

00:14:06.341 --> 00:14:09.481
most of the time it won't be the
data analyst who takes the action.

00:14:09.791 --> 00:14:13.991
It will be someone else like a
store manager business owner or

00:14:14.001 --> 00:14:18.251
CEO or whoever that is who can take
that action or make the decision.

00:14:18.571 --> 00:14:23.161
It's also the data analyst's job to
persuade them to make that decision.

00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:24.501
how do we persuade them?

00:14:24.761 --> 00:14:27.950
by backing our claims with
evidence showing that Okay.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:32.500
This is exactly the time when
you introduce the BYO bag policy,

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.220
the trend started to go down.

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:35.980
So we need to do something on it.

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:40.350
And then the action will be taken and then
the business will get value out of it.

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.820
hope that makes sense
now with this example?

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:49.170
This is another example that I
that I have taken out from the

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.350
recent immigration report as well.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.010
So you if you.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:56.020
I believe most of you are international
students, so if you are international

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:59.060
students you probably are familiar
with the recent immigration changes

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:04.770
that they are trying to reduce the
number of years on your temporary

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:09.050
graduate visa and all the other changes,

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:15.320
but the data behind all of that
migration policy changes was this.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:18.850
And I got this screenshot from
their immigration report itself.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:22.800
So this was the data that
they acted upon, right?

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.920
They had the data, which was like
how many students, how many graduate

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:30.270
students they have, how many of them
are working in related jobs, how many of

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:34.160
them are staying here a long time, how
many of them are switching courses and

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.820
all those things they have data about.

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:39.740
And they converted that
data into this knowledge.

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:44.670
And then this knowledge was
acted upon and they proposed

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:46.920
changes in the Migration Act.

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:51.340
And now we have seen that it's already
been implemented from July 1 and we

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:53.730
have already seen that in action.

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:59.070
So that's a true example of data
in action, is they had the data,

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:02.850
they brought it into information,
they converted that into knowledge.

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:04.930
they brought in a lot of domain export.

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:09.480
there was actually a skill
conference they did in Canberra.

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:13.380
And that was the process of converting
this information into knowledge.

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:16.630
So the information probably said that,
okay, this is the trend, like this

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:18.720
is the trend of students coming in.

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:20.190
Students switching their courses.

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:23.760
This is the trend of student
staying in temporary graduate

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:24.960
visas and all those things.

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:29.790
They had those trends and analysis and
they combine that analysis with domain

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:31.940
expertise in that skills conference.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:37.730
And they got some recommendations
and actions, which was later

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:39.720
implemented in the Migration Act.

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:43.860
So this is how you can see a
lot of government reports and

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:47.310
government actions that you see
will always be backed by data.

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:50.900
And if you look at their reports,
it will actually see how the data

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:54.240
was collected, how the data was
used, and how the decision was made.

00:16:54.885 --> 00:16:59.185
And this is, again, one of the things that
I will recommend to everyone who wants

00:16:59.185 --> 00:17:04.395
to become a data analyst or any analyst
where reporting is necessary, reporting is

00:17:04.405 --> 00:17:09.045
useful, is have a look at other reports,
because that's where we learn from, right?

00:17:09.085 --> 00:17:12.795
Because this is probably like
the highest level or highest

00:17:12.855 --> 00:17:14.775
impact report that you can find.

00:17:15.135 --> 00:17:19.025
So if you can read that and
see what processes follows.

00:17:19.385 --> 00:17:22.655
Then that will help you build your
own reports as well when you become

00:17:22.655 --> 00:17:26.105
a data analyst,  these are the kind
of things you need to look out for.

00:17:26.335 --> 00:17:28.425
There will be a lot of
reports from governments.

00:17:28.425 --> 00:17:32.005
There will be a lot of reports
from those accounting firms or

00:17:32.015 --> 00:17:33.345
those consulting firms as well.

00:17:33.345 --> 00:17:34.645
They produce a lot of reports.

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:38.650
Even private companies, they produce
a lot of reports like annual reports

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:42.190
and some reports on their different
projects or whatever they are working on.

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:46.150
So it's really good to look
through those reports and see

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:48.400
how data is being used in there.

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:52.770
And that will give you a really good
idea of, okay, I never thought this kind

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:54.700
of data can be used for this purpose.

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:58.120
Or, yeah, that's a really
interesting use case of using this

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.550
data for driving this decision.

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:03.640
So that's how I would
encourage you to learn.

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:07.470
And again, like we're not talking about
tools and everything here we are here to

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:12.360
talk about this mindset and that's the
way to develop your mindset is obviously

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.390
by seeing what other people are doing.

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:18.210
And in this case, not even other
people, it's other organizations

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:19.500
or other government bodies.

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:23.120
I highly recommend you to find these
kinds of reports and yeah, have

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:28.350
a look through and see how data
actually is used in real workplaces.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:33.740
Let's now talk about what makes a
good data professional, because we

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:35.310
are here to  become a data analyst.

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:40.900
So let's learn what makes a good data
professional, or a good data analyst.

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:44.840
It's not being good with the tool alone.

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.460
A good data professional
will have these qualities.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:50.180
Data professional deals
with data on daily basis.

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:53.060
And it's not just about
numbers and algorithm.

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:58.130
It's about the individual who breathe
life into the figures, transforms

00:18:58.130 --> 00:18:59.750
them into actionable insights.

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:02.830
But let's see what sets them apart.

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:06.450
So how does a good data professional
looks like versus what the rest

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:08.460
of the  professionals look like.

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:08.840
Okay.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:11.740
The data professionals
are  problem solvers.

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:16.920
Because as a data analyst, you
are not hired to analyze the data.

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:20.080
That's probably what the job
responsibility says, but you are

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.980
analyzing the data to solve a problem.

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:28.010
So the problem is always the  key thing
here,   it's not what analysis you can do.

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:29.810
It's not what graph you can produce.

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:32.310
It's about what problem you can solve.

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:35.710
At the core, data professional
are problem solvers.

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.340
They don't just dive into data.

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:43.440
They first understand what the business
challenge or what the business problem is.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.620
And the value always lies
in solving the problem.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:50.890
The value doesn't come from
a fancy graph or a dashboard.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:56.760
The value comes from solving a problem,
and a good data analyst always knows that.

00:19:57.030 --> 00:20:01.670
They always try to understand what
the business problem is, and then

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:03.270
try to build a solution for that.

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:06.560
Always look at things from
problem solving perspective.

00:20:06.611 --> 00:20:10.201
. We're not here to just analyze,
we're here to solve a problem.

00:20:11.061 --> 00:20:15.521
And maybe when we're doing the analysis,
we can probably uncover even more problem.

00:20:15.651 --> 00:20:19.331
Because when we look at the trends,
maybe we uncover that, yeah, we

00:20:19.331 --> 00:20:24.011
thought that there was problem one,
there is also this problem two.

00:20:24.011 --> 00:20:28.601
And now you will try to solve those
both problems because, yeah, you just

00:20:28.611 --> 00:20:32.901
uncovered this new problem with your
analysis and you will need to solve it.

00:20:32.951 --> 00:20:36.401
Because only the solution
of a problem gives us value.

00:20:36.401 --> 00:20:41.051
as a good data professional, you need
to make sure that the data that you're

00:20:41.061 --> 00:20:43.621
working with is of high quality.

00:20:44.311 --> 00:20:49.431
Because if your data is not good,
you can never produce good insights.

00:20:50.041 --> 00:20:54.801
Because as the proverb goes,
it's garbage in, garbage out.

00:20:55.551 --> 00:21:00.751
So no matter how good analysis you do,
if your data was rubbish, or if your data

00:21:00.751 --> 00:21:07.241
was bad to begin with, your analysis will
always be bad because it's on wrong data,

00:21:07.751 --> 00:21:13.841
so you  always need to be an advocate
of data integrity and data quality, and

00:21:13.841 --> 00:21:19.381
that's, something that people expect
you to say in the interviews as well.

00:21:19.591 --> 00:21:24.728
If you are going to an interview to
become a data analyst and you never

00:21:24.728 --> 00:21:29.160
mentioned the word data cleaning, or you
never mentioned the word data quality.

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:34.800
then they will doubt have you actually
worked in the real world scenario.

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:40.350
Because in the real world scenario, the
data quality is what matters the most.

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:44.880
Because yeah, if you don't have good
quality data, nothing else matters.

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:50.020
No matter how sophisticated AI model
you build, if your data is not correct,

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:52.200
the output will not be correct.

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:56.965
So always keep in mind, Data
quality matters the most.

00:21:56.965 --> 00:22:00.165
So that's the second trait
of a good data professional.

00:22:00.165 --> 00:22:04.515
And again, these are the kinds of
things that people or the employer will

00:22:04.515 --> 00:22:08.175
notice when selecting their candidates.

00:22:09.045 --> 00:22:12.155
So yes, they know the tool,
but are they problem solver?

00:22:12.685 --> 00:22:13.875
Can they communicate well?

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:15.910
Do they know about data quality?

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:18.550
Do they value data quality
in all those kinds of things?

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:23.050
That's what differentiates a good
candidate from an average candidate.

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:26.960
And an average candidate never
gets hired because they were

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:28.660
only looking for one person.

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:32.150
And obviously if there is a good
candidate, they go for a good candidate.

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:35.940
So we need to become that good
candidate, not the average candidate

00:22:35.941 --> 00:22:37.451
So the first thing was problem solving.

00:22:37.516 --> 00:22:39.676
Second thing is data integrity advocates.

00:22:39.686 --> 00:22:44.506
So being able advocate for the data
quality or knowing that the data

00:22:44.506 --> 00:22:46.296
quality is what matters the most.

00:22:46.296 --> 00:22:49.266
Third is evidence based decision maker.

00:22:49.276 --> 00:22:53.386
So always ground your
conclusions on evidence.

00:22:53.576 --> 00:22:55.376
Don't go for just for gut feeling.

00:22:55.516 --> 00:22:59.456
Sometimes, yeah, gut feelings are okay,
But even when you have a gut feeling,

00:22:59.866 --> 00:23:02.336
you still need to back it up with data.

00:23:02.956 --> 00:23:06.946
I can't just say,  go and build
another franchise because your

00:23:06.946 --> 00:23:08.306
franchises are doing good.

00:23:08.826 --> 00:23:13.966
But maybe it won't do good in that suburb
where we are trying to open the franchise.

00:23:14.396 --> 00:23:16.356
Do I have enough data to support that?

00:23:17.046 --> 00:23:17.356
No.

00:23:17.556 --> 00:23:19.746
But maybe I just have a gut
feeling, maybe I know that

00:23:19.746 --> 00:23:21.106
suburb and then I just said it.

00:23:22.176 --> 00:23:24.346
, as a data professional, I cannot do that.

00:23:24.546 --> 00:23:28.086
every  recommendations that I
make has to be backed with data.

00:23:28.086 --> 00:23:32.216
As a data analyst  we provide
suggestion to C level executives,

00:23:32.216 --> 00:23:36.986
we provide suggestion to high level
managers, and there can be multi

00:23:36.986 --> 00:23:41.596
million dollar decisions that are
made based on those suggestions.

00:23:41.996 --> 00:23:47.336
So you have to be extra cautious that
you are making suggestions based on

00:23:47.346 --> 00:23:49.436
data alone, not on your gut feeling.

00:23:50.126 --> 00:23:52.016
Yes, gut feelings are always good.

00:23:52.056 --> 00:23:56.276
Like you have to have some gut feelings,
but you need to have some data to

00:23:56.286 --> 00:23:59.816
validate that gut feelings   in our
upcoming sessions, we will dive more

00:23:59.826 --> 00:24:04.056
into statistical analysis and what
are the kind of statistical test you

00:24:04.056 --> 00:24:07.426
can do to back your recommendation.

00:24:07.436 --> 00:24:12.641
For example, if you're saying that, okay,
we should So to close this franchise, what

00:24:12.641 --> 00:24:14.801
are the numbers you have to support that?

00:24:15.121 --> 00:24:17.371
What kind of tests you
have done to support that?

00:24:17.481 --> 00:24:22.071
So we learn all about that, the
necessary testing that we need

00:24:22.101 --> 00:24:25.001
to do to support our claims.

00:24:25.001 --> 00:24:29.181
Okay, so we've gone with problem
solving, data quality, and

00:24:29.181 --> 00:24:30.711
evidence based decision making.

00:24:30.941 --> 00:24:33.731
So next up is data storyteller.

00:24:33.861 --> 00:24:36.361
So this is where the
communication skill comes in.

00:24:36.361 --> 00:24:40.681
No matter how groundbreaking
analysis you have done, no matter

00:24:40.681 --> 00:24:45.891
how pretty your graph is, If it is
not communicated efficiently to the

00:24:45.901 --> 00:24:49.331
decision makers, then nothing matters.

00:24:49.881 --> 00:24:56.281
If a decision is not made, if an action
is not taken, your analysis does nothing.

00:24:56.281 --> 00:25:00.691
And that's why data analysts has to
have really good communication skills.

00:25:01.251 --> 00:25:06.596
So you can do your analysis, but you also
need to be able to sell your analysis.

00:25:06.866 --> 00:25:10.936
It's like a sales skill in that
term, it's because you have done

00:25:10.936 --> 00:25:12.646
something, you have done this analysis.

00:25:13.046 --> 00:25:17.616
Now you're trying to convince someone
to take action based on this analysis.

00:25:17.616 --> 00:25:18.956
You are selling your idea.

00:25:19.126 --> 00:25:23.646
So your idea is that based on my
analysis, we need to close this franchise.

00:25:23.836 --> 00:25:28.856
So you are trying to sell this idea to
whoever is going to take that action.

00:25:29.126 --> 00:25:32.741
So you are your own sales
person in that case,

00:25:33.401 --> 00:25:37.851
data storytelling is a technique
or it's more of an art.

00:25:38.071 --> 00:25:43.031
So it's an art of communicating
insights from your data in a

00:25:43.071 --> 00:25:45.521
cohesive and persuasive way.

00:25:45.521 --> 00:25:51.146
So a story has to be cohesive as well,
which means it has to lead to us the

00:25:51.156 --> 00:25:53.276
same recommendation or same action.

00:25:53.536 --> 00:25:55.456
You can't be like, okay,
we can also do this.

00:25:55.456 --> 00:25:56.356
We can also do that.

00:25:56.586 --> 00:25:57.746
And 10 different things.

00:25:58.556 --> 00:26:00.916
Then what are you trying to say?

00:26:00.976 --> 00:26:02.436
What are you trying to sell here?

00:26:02.671 --> 00:26:07.141
So it has to be cohesive and it
also has to be persuasive as well,

00:26:07.181 --> 00:26:11.051
which means  it should be telling
that person to take accents.

00:26:11.051 --> 00:26:12.901
And that's what data
storytelling is about.

00:26:13.301 --> 00:26:17.851
We have got a, separate data storytelling
section where we talk about all these

00:26:17.851 --> 00:26:20.871
kind of things, how to make your
story cohesive, how to make your

00:26:20.871 --> 00:26:25.131
story more persuasive, what kind of
visuals to use, what kind of story

00:26:25.131 --> 00:26:29.401
to use, all those things we learn
in the data storytelling section.

00:26:29.401 --> 00:26:32.201
And knowledgeable and confident.

00:26:32.851 --> 00:26:38.151
So every time you you communicate
your insights or every time

00:26:38.151 --> 00:26:42.261
you're trying to propose something
it's normal to get setbacks.

00:26:42.321 --> 00:26:44.811
It's normal to get  questions, right?

00:26:45.051 --> 00:26:50.201
As a data analyst, you probably trying to
propose a solution to a problem that is.

00:26:50.901 --> 00:26:56.511
Maybe different from what they have
expected or maybe different from

00:26:56.521 --> 00:26:58.071
what they currently used to do.

00:26:58.561 --> 00:27:02.841
And that, that can happen because
data will tell you the truth.

00:27:03.111 --> 00:27:06.491
The data will suggest that, okay,
we need to stop doing this and start

00:27:06.491 --> 00:27:10.186
doing that  now you are presenting
this recommendation which could

00:27:10.186 --> 00:27:12.096
be quite strange to your audience.

00:27:12.416 --> 00:27:15.956
So you need to be prepared
for those hard questions.

00:27:16.186 --> 00:27:19.216
Where does answering those
hard questions come from?

00:27:19.686 --> 00:27:21.526
Is by being knowledgeable.

00:27:21.806 --> 00:27:27.006
So you can back your, obviously there is
data to back your claims obviously there

00:27:27.006 --> 00:27:29.236
will be analysis to back your claim.

00:27:29.766 --> 00:27:32.946
But you can also expand it and say, Okay.

00:27:33.346 --> 00:27:36.476
Because company B was facing
the similar situation as well,

00:27:36.766 --> 00:27:38.836
and they fixed it by doing this.

00:27:39.166 --> 00:27:43.096
So we can follow the similar
practice because our data or our

00:27:43.096 --> 00:27:44.856
trend is similar to their trend.

00:27:45.336 --> 00:27:47.071
So it's not just about your analysis.

00:27:47.071 --> 00:27:50.672
It could be from other examples
and other reports and  whatever

00:27:50.672 --> 00:27:52.636
you can get your hands on.

00:27:53.066 --> 00:27:58.886
You can combine them and present it to,
to back your claims  and that's what being

00:27:58.896 --> 00:28:04.756
knowledgeable and confident means is you
just don't rely on your analysis itself

00:28:04.766 --> 00:28:09.136
you need to expand or you need to broaden
your knowledge and be knowledgeable on

00:28:09.496 --> 00:28:12.896
what other people are doing in similar
scenarios and all those kind of thing.

00:28:13.146 --> 00:28:16.056
And how do we become
knowledgeable and confident.

00:28:16.066 --> 00:28:21.346
That's the last point is by
becoming a continuous learner.

00:28:21.636 --> 00:28:26.376
. Learning never stops, I guess it's true
in every profession, but especially

00:28:26.376 --> 00:28:28.466
in data field it just never ends.

00:28:29.036 --> 00:28:32.066
Because, there probably will be like
new technology that's coming in,

00:28:32.326 --> 00:28:34.436
maybe there is new trends coming in.

00:28:34.841 --> 00:28:40.191
whatever it might be, you always
need to be up to date with those new

00:28:40.191 --> 00:28:43.781
advancements, what others are doing,
because things change quite often.

00:28:44.371 --> 00:28:48.151
And not just those technologies
and things, as a data professional,

00:28:48.151 --> 00:28:52.381
you also need to have some
understanding of the regulations.

00:28:52.381 --> 00:28:56.696
For example, you are handling sensitive
data, and then there probably is a

00:28:56.696 --> 00:29:00.326
regulation on sensitive data saying
that, okay, the sensitive data

00:29:00.476 --> 00:29:04.226
cannot leave your laptop, or you
cannot make a copy of sensitive data

00:29:04.226 --> 00:29:05.406
when you are doing the analysis.

00:29:06.196 --> 00:29:10.006
You need to be aware of those regulations,
and then there could be things like

00:29:10.206 --> 00:29:13.726
which, which are applied countrywide,

00:29:13.806 --> 00:29:19.466
so there are some data regulations
on Australia . For example, health

00:29:19.476 --> 00:29:24.416
data of any Australian citizen cannot
leave Australia, ? So you cannot

00:29:24.426 --> 00:29:27.646
make a copy of it somewhere, even
for analysis purpose or anything.

00:29:27.646 --> 00:29:29.506
And  those kind of regulations can change.

00:29:29.536 --> 00:29:34.066
Maybe tomorrow they will say, okay, not
just the health information, but also

00:29:34.506 --> 00:29:38.006
purchase history information of Australia
and cannot go outside of Australia.

00:29:38.396 --> 00:29:42.846
If that regulation comes in tomorrow,
you need to be on top of that as well,

00:29:43.136 --> 00:29:46.656
because maybe you are doing some analysis,
maybe you are creating some copy.

00:29:46.656 --> 00:29:50.336
Now you need to stop creating those copies
because the regulations have changed.

00:29:50.337 --> 00:29:54.266
And that's again that's the kind of
thing you need to stay up to date with.

00:29:54.901 --> 00:29:58.751
And that's what being, being a data
professional is about,  so you have

00:29:58.751 --> 00:30:02.641
to be knowledgeable, you have to be up
to date, and the learning never ends.

00:30:02.641 --> 00:30:08.321
So how does this help me , like
right now, if I know this is what a

00:30:08.321 --> 00:30:13.581
good data professional looks like,
then this is exactly the thing my

00:30:13.581 --> 00:30:16.281
employer are looking in my resume.

00:30:17.501 --> 00:30:23.061
So now I will take this information and
I will try to implement it in my resume.

00:30:23.741 --> 00:30:27.971
So in my resume , I will start
thinking about, how do I present

00:30:27.981 --> 00:30:30.381
myself as a good problem solver?

00:30:31.191 --> 00:30:32.451
I need to work out on that.

00:30:32.451 --> 00:30:37.181
Second thing, how do I present myself
as an advocate of data quality?

00:30:38.381 --> 00:30:39.231
I need to work on that.

00:30:40.061 --> 00:30:42.971
How do I present myself as
a good data storyteller?

00:30:43.681 --> 00:30:46.331
How do I present myself
as a continuous learner?

00:30:46.411 --> 00:30:49.111
How do I present myself as
knowledgeable and confident?

00:30:49.791 --> 00:30:51.391
Those are the things I need to work on.

00:30:51.741 --> 00:30:55.111
Because before they see me,
they only see my resume.

00:30:55.111 --> 00:30:58.831
So my resume needs to tell them
that I am a good data professional.

00:30:58.831 --> 00:31:02.631
And only then you get the interviews
and then you can take on the next step.

00:31:03.181 --> 00:31:10.051
But first thing is you need to make them
sure that looking at your resume alone

00:31:10.311 --> 00:31:13.521
they can tell you that okay, this person
will make a good data professional.

00:31:13.801 --> 00:31:15.421
Or this person will make
a good data analyst.

00:31:15.431 --> 00:31:15.491
Thank you.

00:31:16.346 --> 00:31:20.946
And that's the intent of this that's
why I'm teaching you this or I'm going

00:31:20.946 --> 00:31:27.726
through this topic, is you need to
know what your employers are expecting.

00:31:28.096 --> 00:31:31.596
Because otherwise, how do you know
whether you are doing good or bad?

00:31:31.966 --> 00:31:34.206
Let's talk about  mindset
of a data professional.

00:31:34.206 --> 00:31:39.666
And again, like this helps a lot when
you are pitching yourself because you

00:31:39.666 --> 00:31:41.296
are here to become a data professional.

00:31:41.326 --> 00:31:46.716
So you need to learn how to think like
one, because when you think like one,

00:31:46.726 --> 00:31:51.366
you become one and that's probably a
lot of the missing piece when you are

00:31:51.366 --> 00:31:54.746
trying to do your self learning, when
you are trying to learn a tools just to

00:31:54.746 --> 00:32:00.286
become a data analyst is, yes, you can
learn those tools and technologies, but

00:32:00.286 --> 00:32:02.536
it's really hard to learn the mindset.

00:32:02.886 --> 00:32:06.596
And that's what differentiates
between, a good data analyst

00:32:06.656 --> 00:32:08.596
and an average data analyst.

00:32:08.756 --> 00:32:11.046
So let's start with the mindset.

00:32:11.196 --> 00:32:12.186
So first thing.

00:32:12.806 --> 00:32:15.456
Obviously, you always
start with a problem.

00:32:15.546 --> 00:32:16.976
You do not start with the data.

00:32:17.106 --> 00:32:19.646
It's not okay, I have this
data in hand, what can I do?

00:32:19.666 --> 00:32:20.876
That's not gonna work.

00:32:20.966 --> 00:32:23.546
Yeah, if you're talking about your
personal projects or projects for your

00:32:23.546 --> 00:32:25.926
uni, maybe that will work that way.

00:32:26.276 --> 00:32:30.226
But in the business world, no one cares
about what you can do with that data.

00:32:30.226 --> 00:32:33.836
What people care about is whether
you can solve our problem or not.

00:32:34.416 --> 00:32:38.547
So data, starting with data that's
always the wrong assumption.

00:32:39.087 --> 00:32:43.467
And that's the thing even when I was
at uni, that's how I used to think.

00:32:43.857 --> 00:32:46.257
I always like, okay, what
kind of what data do I have?

00:32:46.257 --> 00:32:47.407
What can I do with this data?

00:32:47.987 --> 00:32:50.907
And no one really cares about
what I can do with that data.

00:32:51.427 --> 00:32:52.987
People care about their own problems.

00:32:53.407 --> 00:32:58.017
So instead of that, what I
should be looking for is what

00:32:58.017 --> 00:32:59.057
sort of problems are out there.

00:32:59.057 --> 00:33:02.357
For example, maybe I'm
interested in transportation.

00:33:02.887 --> 00:33:07.767
So I go out and it could probably
come from my own experience as well.

00:33:07.777 --> 00:33:11.037
It's okay, every day I
use trains and buses.

00:33:11.567 --> 00:33:13.197
What are the problems that I face?

00:33:14.297 --> 00:33:18.187
Maybe that problem is I don't
know how far away the bus is.

00:33:18.497 --> 00:33:22.057
So  if I am using that service
every day, there probably are some

00:33:22.067 --> 00:33:23.557
problems that I face every day.

00:33:24.472 --> 00:33:29.852
And now I will start with that problem and
then think about, okay, what are the data

00:33:29.862 --> 00:33:32.082
points I might need to solve this problem?

00:33:32.692 --> 00:33:35.512
So then I will start looking for the data.

00:33:35.612 --> 00:33:38.802
If I can't find the data, I
will maybe talk to people,

00:33:38.842 --> 00:33:43.652
talk to  other organizations to
find and help me get that data.

00:33:44.112 --> 00:33:47.572
But getting the data in the
hand is not the starting point.

00:33:47.712 --> 00:33:50.212
The starting point is always
identifying the problem.

00:33:50.212 --> 00:33:54.162
And yeah, there probably are some problems
that you cannot solve with data alone,

00:33:54.552 --> 00:33:58.842
which is fine because you have not all
problems can be solved with data alone.

00:33:59.182 --> 00:34:02.032
They probably will need to
be some software changes.

00:34:02.032 --> 00:34:06.652
Are there some, a lot of other kinds of
changes that needs to happen, so not all

00:34:06.652 --> 00:34:08.602
of problems  can be solved with data.

00:34:09.172 --> 00:34:12.002
But when you're thinking about
your project or when you're

00:34:12.022 --> 00:34:13.322
thinking about anything to do.

00:34:13.587 --> 00:34:16.057
To start with the problem
and how you can solve it.

00:34:16.067 --> 00:34:19.467
And next is the data acquisition.

00:34:19.667 --> 00:34:21.707
So quality matters.

00:34:21.717 --> 00:34:23.857
So now you have identified your problem.

00:34:23.857 --> 00:34:26.317
Now  you go into the
data acquisition phase.

00:34:26.367 --> 00:34:28.817
So data acquisition means
just getting  the data.

00:34:28.817 --> 00:34:32.497
And maybe there are a lot of different
sources that I can get the data from.

00:34:32.497 --> 00:34:35.147
And that's where I need to
factor in the data quality.

00:34:35.647 --> 00:34:39.677
What would be the best quality
data or where I can find

00:34:39.677 --> 00:34:42.127
the best quality data, okay?

00:34:42.267 --> 00:34:46.957
For example, let's say I want to do
mean income analysis of all Australian.

00:34:47.877 --> 00:34:50.037
So let's imagine this scenario.

00:34:50.037 --> 00:34:52.957
I want to calculate the average.

00:34:53.587 --> 00:34:58.307
income of all Australians based
on different suburbs, right?

00:34:58.307 --> 00:35:01.757
So I want average income of each
suburb, like this suburb versus that

00:35:01.757 --> 00:35:02.977
suburb and all those kind of things.

00:35:03.337 --> 00:35:05.027
So I want to do that analysis.

00:35:05.387 --> 00:35:12.137
And now I'm trying to find the
right data for that analysis.

00:35:12.587 --> 00:35:16.407
So can anyone tell me where
could be the best place?

00:35:16.427 --> 00:35:19.167
So there probably are
different places we can get it.

00:35:19.622 --> 00:35:22.822
But where could be the best
place to get that data from?

00:35:23.992 --> 00:35:24.842
Any ideas?

00:35:25.342 --> 00:35:26.892
Yep, ATO that's correct.

00:35:26.922 --> 00:35:29.532
In this scenario, there are a
couple of ways we can do it,  so

00:35:29.532 --> 00:35:32.851
there is Australian Bureau of
Statistics, which does the census.

00:35:33.372 --> 00:35:37.712
So when they do the census, and in
Australia census is mandatory, so

00:35:37.712 --> 00:35:39.432
you cannot skip the census as well.

00:35:39.432 --> 00:35:43.362
So you can get this data from Australian
Bureau of Statistics, which does

00:35:43.372 --> 00:35:45.622
the census where you report your

00:35:46.052 --> 00:35:50.424
Incomes and all those other details
that they that they ask you to fill

00:35:50.424 --> 00:35:54.964
out, so that's one way we can obviously
get it from Bureau of Statistics.

00:35:55.524 --> 00:35:59.504
The other way is Australian Taxes
and Office, because everyone

00:35:59.524 --> 00:36:02.884
needs to do their taxes, so they
obviously fill out their income.

00:36:03.474 --> 00:36:08.014
Between Australian Bureau
of Statistics and ATO, which

00:36:08.014 --> 00:36:09.424
will have better quality data?

00:36:09.974 --> 00:36:11.074
So it will be ATO.

00:36:11.114 --> 00:36:14.174
Because in AVS, you are
self reporting, right?

00:36:14.174 --> 00:36:15.854
So you're not, you're
probably just self reporting.

00:36:16.314 --> 00:36:19.514
Say, putting yourself in
certain bracket you don't put

00:36:19.514 --> 00:36:23.004
in like my income is 95, 536.

00:36:23.234 --> 00:36:26.794
It will just say it's between
000 and something like that.

00:36:27.294 --> 00:36:30.614
And that is self reported, so
it's not necessarily that I need

00:36:30.614 --> 00:36:31.984
to put my right information.

00:36:32.384 --> 00:36:35.834
Even if I make 100k, I'll probably
put in as like 80k in ABS.

00:36:36.184 --> 00:36:36.354
And.

00:36:36.769 --> 00:36:37.909
No one really checks that.

00:36:37.964 --> 00:36:42.074
So even though you can get the
data from av s you know that it

00:36:42.074 --> 00:36:46.124
is self-reported and yeah, people
can report whatever they want.

00:36:46.694 --> 00:36:49.034
But in a TO, it's not self-reported.

00:36:49.204 --> 00:36:54.754
It's actually enforced and it gets,
it has the data up to the, maybe up

00:36:54.754 --> 00:36:58.024
to the sense, I think it, you will
have your income up to the sense so

00:36:58.024 --> 00:36:59.704
that you can do the tax calculation.

00:37:00.219 --> 00:37:07.279
So ATO's data will definitely be of really
high quality compared to the ADS data.

00:37:07.279 --> 00:37:12.589
So that's just an example on showing
like, yes, you could have data coming

00:37:12.589 --> 00:37:19.309
from like different data sources, but
as much as possible, you have to get

00:37:19.479 --> 00:37:21.469
the data with the highest quality.

00:37:21.469 --> 00:37:24.819
And in this example, like obviously
ATO is not going to give us the

00:37:25.119 --> 00:37:27.059
annual income of everyone, right?

00:37:27.059 --> 00:37:30.959
If we're just normal people, if
we work in ATO, maybe they will.

00:37:31.289 --> 00:37:34.299
But as a normal people,
we cannot get that data.

00:37:34.929 --> 00:37:39.129
But as a normal people, as a
public, we can get data from AVS.

00:37:39.179 --> 00:37:42.549
So if you want to see the average
annual income of your suburb,

00:37:42.849 --> 00:37:45.549
you can actually see it in fema.

00:37:45.549 --> 00:37:49.444
gov So sometimes there can be
constraints that even though you

00:37:49.454 --> 00:37:53.584
know that the high quality data
exists, you just can't access it.

00:37:53.904 --> 00:37:58.324
So now you have to work with
the best available data, right?

00:37:58.344 --> 00:38:02.024
So and then the best available
data maybe is just ABS there.

00:38:02.304 --> 00:38:05.734
So that way sometimes there will
be constraint to get some data.

00:38:06.014 --> 00:38:09.854
So you have to work with what
data you have, but the gist is

00:38:09.864 --> 00:38:13.859
you always need to look for the
highest quality data available.

00:38:14.409 --> 00:38:16.509
Because we talked about it previously.

00:38:16.509 --> 00:38:18.069
It's garbage in garbage out.

00:38:18.229 --> 00:38:24.399
If your data quality is not good, your
analysis would not be any good than that.

00:38:24.399 --> 00:38:27.679
And the power of exploratory
analysis, sorry, that's a typo,

00:38:27.909 --> 00:38:30.089
the power of exploratory analysis.

00:38:30.599 --> 00:38:37.579
So before you dive deep into your deeper
analysis, what a good data analyst

00:38:37.629 --> 00:38:42.159
do is they always do some exploratory
analysis, which is like a quick checks.

00:38:42.159 --> 00:38:46.919
For instance, if I want to do that,
the same example I want to do the

00:38:46.919 --> 00:38:51.129
average annual salary of a sub of,
then I will do a quick check and see

00:38:51.499 --> 00:38:53.039
what the distribution looks like.

00:38:53.554 --> 00:38:55.364
And how many data points I have got.

00:38:55.724 --> 00:38:59.474
If I got less data points, maybe
the average won't make much

00:38:59.484 --> 00:39:02.494
sense because, yeah, I don't know
where that data point came from.

00:39:03.034 --> 00:39:06.604
So I will keep that in mind and I
will do that exploratory analysis to

00:39:06.604 --> 00:39:10.844
quickly check how the data is, what
the distribution looks like whether

00:39:10.844 --> 00:39:13.964
there are any anomalies, whether
there are any outliers in the data,

00:39:13.964 --> 00:39:15.824
I will quickly do that analysis.

00:39:16.349 --> 00:39:19.969
Because after that when I do
the deeper analysis, which is

00:39:19.979 --> 00:39:21.809
probably I'm building some models.

00:39:21.809 --> 00:39:26.009
I'm probably building some Pattern
findings and all those kind of things.

00:39:26.499 --> 00:39:31.599
I don't want to spend much time
There if the data is wrong.

00:39:32.139 --> 00:39:36.999
So this is my first checkpoint in
saying yeah Is this data enough or

00:39:37.009 --> 00:39:39.729
sufficient or of good enough quality?

00:39:40.179 --> 00:39:43.899
for Pursuing the later analysis.

00:39:44.069 --> 00:39:48.119
And that's why it's called exploratory
analysis And we actually have a session

00:39:48.119 --> 00:39:52.869
dedicated to exploratory analysis
itself, where we talk about what sort

00:39:52.869 --> 00:39:57.069
of checks you need to do to make sure
that you have got the right data and

00:39:57.069 --> 00:40:00.439
sufficient data for your further analysis.

00:40:01.299 --> 00:40:05.309
And this is like really helpful,
especially in work terms as well,

00:40:05.709 --> 00:40:10.774
is because if you skip this, You
will spend quite a long time on

00:40:10.824 --> 00:40:13.494
doing those analysis on wrong data.

00:40:14.084 --> 00:40:18.934
So it's better to find out one
month earlier, than finding out one

00:40:18.934 --> 00:40:22.524
month later where you have done all
these things with the data, but you

00:40:22.524 --> 00:40:23.994
find out that the data was wrong,

00:40:23.994 --> 00:40:29.384
so that's what the exploratory analysis
prevents, is to wasting your time on

00:40:29.404 --> 00:40:32.494
something when the data was not there
to begin with in the first place.

00:40:33.584 --> 00:40:35.664
So that's the exploratory analysis.

00:40:35.724 --> 00:40:39.484
And again, a good data analyst
would always do that exploratory

00:40:39.484 --> 00:40:43.494
analysis before they do the
deep down analytics on any data.

00:40:43.494 --> 00:40:45.184
And deep down with purpose.

00:40:45.384 --> 00:40:51.384
So when you do that deep dive analysis,
you have to have a purpose in mind

00:40:51.734 --> 00:40:57.214
because otherwise it can take forever
because analysis is like, if you don't

00:40:57.214 --> 00:40:59.424
have an end goal it can go on and on.

00:40:59.734 --> 00:41:00.904
You try to do this thing.

00:41:00.934 --> 00:41:05.484
It doesn't work to do other thing you
are trying to combine more things.

00:41:05.484 --> 00:41:07.734
And , if you don't have
an end goal, it just.

00:41:08.104 --> 00:41:09.034
Goes on and on.

00:41:09.434 --> 00:41:12.964
So keep that final purpose in mind.

00:41:13.124 --> 00:41:14.574
And what's the final purpose?

00:41:15.104 --> 00:41:19.304
That is driven by the problem that
we started in the first place.

00:41:19.304 --> 00:41:22.404
So we're not doing this analysis
for the sake of the analysis.

00:41:22.774 --> 00:41:25.544
We're doing this analysis
to solve that problem.

00:41:25.914 --> 00:41:30.384
So that will be your purpose and
keep that purpose in mind all the

00:41:30.394 --> 00:41:31.904
time when you're doing the analysis.

00:41:32.184 --> 00:41:35.984
Otherwise this analysis will go nowhere
and you will waste a lot of your time.

00:41:36.314 --> 00:41:39.504
And if you're in a company, you
will waste a lot of their resources.

00:41:39.504 --> 00:41:42.094
From information to actionable knowledge.

00:41:42.324 --> 00:41:45.914
So again, if we call back to our
discussion on data, information, and

00:41:45.914 --> 00:41:51.504
knowledge, once you are done with your
analysis, you produce an information.

00:41:52.049 --> 00:41:55.779
That's not a knowledge as and
it's on unless you have got

00:41:55.779 --> 00:41:57.079
the domain expertise as well.

00:41:57.689 --> 00:42:01.249
So what do you need to do
now is the information that

00:42:01.249 --> 00:42:02.959
you got from your analysis.

00:42:03.169 --> 00:42:06.059
You now need to combine
it with domain expertise.

00:42:06.489 --> 00:42:09.749
And again, if that's the domain you are
already a part of, you can probably.

00:42:10.104 --> 00:42:15.984
do that stage yourself, or you
will probably engage an SME or the

00:42:15.984 --> 00:42:18.204
subject matter expert on that topic.

00:42:18.434 --> 00:42:23.044
And now you and the SME will have
a look at the information and

00:42:23.064 --> 00:42:24.464
they will produce the knowledge.

00:42:24.924 --> 00:42:27.294
And that's the knowledge
that will be presented.

00:42:27.294 --> 00:42:28.244
And that's the knowledge.

00:42:28.624 --> 00:42:32.424
that will be acted on
by the decision makers.

00:42:33.494 --> 00:42:39.664
So in your early stages as a data analyst,
you probably will only be doing that

00:42:39.864 --> 00:42:44.064
information, the creating the information
path, and you probably will have some

00:42:44.064 --> 00:42:49.104
SME or maybe your senior analyst who will
provide that domain expertise to you.

00:42:49.104 --> 00:42:53.604
But later on, as you become more and
more experienced in that domain, you

00:42:53.604 --> 00:42:56.024
will be responsible for the entire thing.

00:42:56.574 --> 00:43:01.294
And that's why a lot of the jobs, if
you see if I look at analyst positions

00:43:01.324 --> 00:43:05.014
or senior analyst position, they will
say if it is in a mining company, they

00:43:05.014 --> 00:43:06.864
will say mining experience preferred.

00:43:07.444 --> 00:43:10.144
If it is a banking company,
banking experience preferred.

00:43:10.934 --> 00:43:11.594
Why is that?

00:43:12.614 --> 00:43:16.294
It's because the information
alone is not enough.

00:43:16.684 --> 00:43:22.154
You need that domain experience, and when
they are coupled, that becomes knowledge,

00:43:22.154 --> 00:43:24.664
and that's what they are looking
for, that they want that knowledge.

00:43:25.244 --> 00:43:27.784
So that knowledge is acted upon.

00:43:28.104 --> 00:43:31.434
Alright, so that's why when you become
senior, you come with that domain

00:43:31.434 --> 00:43:35.044
experience as well, because you probably
have been an analyst in that domain

00:43:35.044 --> 00:43:39.344
for some time, and you know that
domain well, so you will be able to

00:43:39.344 --> 00:43:41.814
do that part, both part on your own.

00:43:42.274 --> 00:43:45.294
But when you're starting with, you
will produce the information, and you

00:43:45.294 --> 00:43:49.554
will need to work with subject matter
expert to convert that into knowledge.

00:43:50.019 --> 00:43:52.969
Because some of the assumptions
in your analysis could be wrong.

00:43:52.969 --> 00:43:58.429
Or the kind of different, weird pattern
that you're seeing, maybe there is

00:43:58.429 --> 00:43:59.929
a different explanation for that.

00:44:00.109 --> 00:44:02.489
Maybe it's in the business operations.

00:44:02.709 --> 00:44:04.179
Maybe it's the seasonality.

00:44:04.259 --> 00:44:09.009
There could be a lot of the things
that is not in the data, but still

00:44:09.009 --> 00:44:11.029
it explains what's happening there.

00:44:11.554 --> 00:44:14.894
And that's what that's what the
domain experience is, information,

00:44:15.184 --> 00:44:17.474
that's what we produce from analysis.

00:44:18.004 --> 00:44:21.984
But the domain expertise comes
from outside, and then that's what

00:44:21.984 --> 00:44:23.944
becomes, makes it the knowledge.

00:44:23.944 --> 00:44:25.354
And reflect and evaluate.

00:44:25.414 --> 00:44:30.904
So this is again, really important one,
is once you are complete, once you're done

00:44:30.904 --> 00:44:35.724
with your project, once you're done with
your work, always reflect and evaluate.

00:44:35.964 --> 00:44:40.374
And in workplace sense, there will be
like formal rituals for this called

00:44:40.684 --> 00:44:44.084
project closures, retrospectives,
and all those kinds of things.

00:44:44.724 --> 00:44:48.154
But in your personal projects
and your personal work as

00:44:48.154 --> 00:44:50.004
well, you can implement that.

00:44:50.829 --> 00:44:57.169
Because during the process of doing
the project, you learn a lot, right?

00:44:57.279 --> 00:45:02.779
By the end of the project, if you
stop and reflect, okay, now if I

00:45:02.789 --> 00:45:07.569
had to do this project again, with
all the knowledge that I have, maybe

00:45:07.569 --> 00:45:09.199
I will do some things differently.

00:45:09.579 --> 00:45:14.059
Because there probably were some learnings
that you did during the project that

00:45:14.209 --> 00:45:19.259
will definitely help you if you were
redoing this project from scratch now.

00:45:19.259 --> 00:45:24.939
And if you note down those learnings, or
if you, Just take a note of what things

00:45:24.939 --> 00:45:29.479
you could have done better and what are
the learnings you got from this project.

00:45:29.799 --> 00:45:34.689
You can use those notes to then
formulate your next project

00:45:34.959 --> 00:45:37.129
and that will be really great.

00:45:37.569 --> 00:45:41.479
Because you did one project, you learned
something from that, and then now you're

00:45:41.509 --> 00:45:43.459
implementing that in the next project.

00:45:43.959 --> 00:45:48.249
And this is how the corporate world
works they do one project, they close it

00:45:48.249 --> 00:45:51.549
out, they take the learnings, and then
they do next project, and then that way

00:45:51.549 --> 00:45:56.169
the project keeps getting better and
better, and they refine their process and

00:45:56.169 --> 00:45:57.839
procedures to make it better and better.

00:45:57.839 --> 00:46:01.019
But we can do that on our personal
life as well, is yeah, I'll

00:46:01.019 --> 00:46:02.669
probably start with a small project.

00:46:02.939 --> 00:46:04.849
I'll do it maybe in one or
two weeks, but that's it.

00:46:05.119 --> 00:46:09.689
But after that one or two weeks, I
will stop and reflect on how I can do

00:46:09.689 --> 00:46:14.359
it better or how if I were to start
this project again, what are the

00:46:14.379 --> 00:46:16.159
things that I will do differently?

00:46:16.719 --> 00:46:17.689
Take note of that.

00:46:17.959 --> 00:46:22.329
And then when you start the next project,
you will do those things differently

00:46:22.939 --> 00:46:24.379
and that will be a better project.

00:46:24.379 --> 00:46:24.589
Okay.

00:46:24.619 --> 00:46:26.449
So, that's the mindset
of a good data professor.

00:46:26.449 --> 00:46:30.459
It's starting with a problem, making
sure you have got the good quality

00:46:30.459 --> 00:46:34.979
data, spending some time in exploratory
analysis so that you don't waste

00:46:34.979 --> 00:46:36.959
your time on doing those deep dives.

00:46:37.624 --> 00:46:41.384
When you are doing the deep dive,
keep in mind what your purpose is.

00:46:41.544 --> 00:46:44.444
And that purpose is driven by
the problem that you started

00:46:44.504 --> 00:46:46.114
to started in the first place.

00:46:46.114 --> 00:46:51.814
And obviously marrying your insights
with domain expertise to convert it into

00:46:51.814 --> 00:46:56.814
knowledge and reflecting and evaluating
upon completion of your project.

00:46:56.964 --> 00:47:01.944
So that's the that's how a data
professional should operate.

00:47:02.584 --> 00:47:02.784
Okay.

00:47:02.804 --> 00:47:04.484
And hopefully this will help you.

00:47:05.234 --> 00:47:08.434
In your personal level as well,
even when you're trying to do your

00:47:08.434 --> 00:47:12.654
personal projects, these steps
will help you get better projects.

00:47:12.654 --> 00:47:13.764
That's all for today.

00:47:14.044 --> 00:47:16.814
Thanks for watching and I
will see you in the next one.
