# Introduction to Data  

## Understanding Data: Beyond the Basics

Data. A simple term, yet its depth is often underestimated. At a glance, you might envision rows and columns filled with numbers, or perhaps databases storing vast amounts of information. But let's delve deeper.  

### What Really is Data?

Data is not merely a static collection of facts and figures. It's a dynamic, ever-evolving entity. Consider the photos on your phone, the pattern of your mouse movements on a website, or even the rhythm of your heartbeat. Each action, each emotion, every click or like, contributes to the vast ocean of data. Even choosing not to engage with content is data in itself.  

### The World Through a Data Lens

For data professionals, the world is a treasure trove of data points. Every interaction, every observation, is a potential source of insights. Our role often involves merging data from disparate sources, sometimes combining datasets that have never been integrated before, to unearth insights previously hidden from view.  

### The Curiosity of a Data Professional

If the idea of discovering new data sources and unearthing hidden insights excites you, you're on the right track. This innate curiosity, this drive to see beyond the obvious, is what sets data professionals apart. So, the next time you encounter data, remember to look beyond the surface. The world around you is brimming with information, waiting to be discovered. Embrace the endless possibilities and embark on your data-driven journey.  

## Data vs. Information vs. Knowledge: The Evolution of Value

In the world of business, while data is the starting point, knowledge is the ultimate goal. It's the key to unlocking the potential of any data-driven initiative and making decisions that drive success.

*   ### The Raw Essence: Data
    
    At its most basic level, data is a raw collection of facts and figures. Think of it as the uncut gemstone, valuable in its own right but not yet refined. In this state, while abundant, data doesn't offer much actionable insight.  
      
    For instance, consider a retail company tracking every customer transaction. These records, by themselves, don't tell the company much.
    
*   ### The Processed Form: Information
    
    When we take this raw data and process it, it transforms into information. This is akin to cutting and polishing the gemstone to reveal its brilliance. Information is data that has been given context, making it more understandable. However, while information provides clarity, it still lacks the depth needed for impactful decision-making.  
      
    In our retail example, the company might discover a trend: the average basket size for each customer is decreasing. While this information provides clarity, it's still not enough to drive impactful business decisions.
    
*   ### The Pinnacle: Knowledge
    
    Knowledge is where the true power lies. It's the result of combining information with past experiences and domain expertise. It's not just about having the facts; it's about understanding the implications of those facts. Knowledge provides the depth and insight necessary to make informed business decisions. It's the finished jewel, set into a piece of jewellery, ready to be showcased.  
      
    In our scenario, the sales manager, with their domain experience, interprets the information and identifies the root cause: the store's BYO bag policy. Armed with this knowledge, the store introduces reusable bags at the counter for $1, effectively addressing the decline in sales and enhancing the customer experience.  
    

### Case Study: Data-Driven Changes in Australian Immigration Policy

### Real-world decisions are increasingly driven by data. Government reports, corporate annual reports, white papers, and other decision-making documents all rely on data to support critical decisions. As a data analyst, these are your treasure troves. Learning from these reports will help you understand how data can be transformed into actionable insights.  
  

#### One recent example is the Australian government’s decision to introduce caps on international student visas and make changes to skilled visa classes. These policy changes were informed by insights derived from extensive data analysis. Let’s explore how this process unfolded.  
  

##### Raw Data Collection

The initial data sources included:

*   **Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)**: Providing statistical data on the Australian population and workforce.
*   **Department of Home Affairs**: Supplying immigration data, including the number and demographics of temporary visa holders.
*   **QILT (Quality Indicators for Learning and Teaching) Graduate Outcomes Survey**: Offering data on the post-graduation employment outcomes of students.

This raw data, however, has limited immediate value. To unlock its potential, it needed to be transformed into _information_.  
  

##### Transforming Data into Information

Data analysts processed the raw data to reveal trends and patterns, such as:

*   The increasing trend of international students in Australia.
*   Employment outcomes of international graduates, specifically how many of them work in roles below their skill level.

Take the infographic below, which shows the occupational skill levels of international graduates with a bachelor’s degree:

More than 50% of international graduates are working in jobs that require skill levels lower than their qualifications. This trend indicated a potential mismatch in the skilled immigration framework, signalling an issue that warranted further investigation.  
  

##### Combining Information with Domain Expertise

While identifying trends and patterns is informative, it's not sufficient to drive policy change. This information needed to be evaluated by experts to form _knowledge_—an actionable understanding of the situation.

During the Skills Summit in Canberra, domain experts from various fields, including educational institutions, the Department of Education, the Department of Home Affairs, Skills Australia, and industry leaders, collaborated. They provided context on factors such as labour market demands, the challenges international graduates face, and the broader impact on the Australian economy.

#####   
Actionable Knowledge: Informing Policy Decisions

By combining data-derived information with domain expertise, the government was able to form a holistic understanding of the situation. This actionable knowledge highlighted the need for adjustments in immigration policy, ultimately leading to new regulations that align better with both economic needs and workforce capabilities.

This example demonstrates that the real value of data lies in its transformation into actionable knowledge. Raw data alone is simply a collection of numbers, but when it's carefully analyzed and combined with domain expertise, it becomes a powerful tool that can guide and shape impactful decisions. For aspiring data analysts, this process is an essential skill to master.  
  

As you develop your data analysis skills, seek out reports like this one from government bodies, industry publications, or academic institutions. Studying real-world examples will help you understand how data is used to uncover insights, identify trends, and ultimately drive change. Practice analysing these reports yourself—ask questions about the data, look for patterns, and consider how the findings might influence decisions. This continuous practice of transforming data into knowledge will strengthen your analytical abilities and bring you closer to becoming a skilled data analyst capable of making a real impact.

## The Evolution of Data: A Paradigm Shift

In the ever-evolving landscape of technology and business, our perspective on data has undergone a significant transformation. This shift is not just about the data itself, but also about how we perceive, process, and utilize it.

### The Traditional Viewpoint

Historically, our approach to data was largely structured. We valued data that conformed to specific, often relational, structures. Anything outside this realm was either reshaped to fit these structures or deemed less valuable. This mindset, while effective for its time, began to show its limitations as the variety and volume of data expanded.

### The Advent of Big Data

Enter the era of big data, while there is not rigid definition of big data, it is commonly understood through its three Vs: Volume, Velocity, and Veracity.

**Volume**

This refers to the sheer amount of data. While there's no fixed threshold distinguishing traditional data from big data, a general rule of thumb is when data outgrows the capacity of a single machine or disk. 

**Velocity**

This captures the speed at which data is generated and the pace at which it needs to be processed. In today's digital age, data streams in from myriad sources at unprecedented rates.

**Veracity**

As the name suggests, this pertains to the reliability and truthfulness of data. With vast volumes of data pouring in rapidly, ensuring its authenticity becomes a challenge.

### Is Big Data still a Thing?

The shift to big data is more than just about managing large datasets. It's about understanding the nuances of diverse data types, ensuring their authenticity, and harnessing their potential in real-time. As we continue to navigate this new terrain, the questions and challenges posed by big data will guide our strategies, tools, and approaches in the data realm.  
  
Today, no one really likes to use the term big data anymore. With the advancement of data technologies, it has become easier to handle large volume of data with ease. However, sometimes the true value might lie in the smaller data. Here is a really nice article ["Is small data the new big data?"](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2016/04/is-small-data-the-new-big-data/) if you would like to explore more on this topic.

## Different Data Types Based on Structures

Based on organization and format, data can be broadly categorized into three types: Structured, Semi-Structured, and Unstructured.

### Structured Data

Structured data is meticulously organized, often visualized in a tabular format with distinct rows and columns. Imagine a spreadsheet detailing customer information, where columns represent attributes like name, address, and phone number. Or consider a database logging sales transaction, segmented by date, amount, and product details. This type of data seamlessly integrates into traditional databases and can be efficiently queried using languages like SQL.

### Semi-Structured Data

Semi-structured data, as the name suggests, possesses some level of organization, though not as stringent as its structured counterpart. A JSON file populated with key-value pairs or an XML document showcasing a nested hierarchy are classic examples. While these data types exhibit certain hierarchical relationships, they aren't strictly enforced, offering a bit more flexibility.

### Unstructured Data

Venturing into the realm of unstructured data, we find elements that lack a definitive format or organization. This category encompasses a wide range of data types, from text documents and email correspondences to social media posts and images. The absence of a clear structure can make unstructured data more challenging to organize and analyse.

### So What?

Now you know that data isn’t just numbers in a spreadsheet—it can be anything! Hopefully, this opens up a world of creative possibilities for your next project. Don’t limit yourself to hunting for sample CSV files online. Look around: the photos and videos on your phone, your app usage history, even the random notes you jotted down last week are all data just waiting to be explored. Imagine analysing your social media feed alongside weather patterns to see if gloomy skies really do bring out the melancholic side of your friends—or maybe it’s just you!  
  

The possibilities are endless. Why not track your sleep patterns against your daily productivity? Or analyse your text messages to see if there's a time of day when you're at peak "LOL" mode. Data is all around you, and when you start thinking outside the box (or spreadsheet), the world becomes one big data playground. Every interaction, every click, and every snapshot is a story waiting to be uncovered, so keep that curiosity alive and keep experimenting. You might be surprised by the insights you find—and who knows, your next project might just go viral for discovering the latest "sad-on-rainy-days" trend!
